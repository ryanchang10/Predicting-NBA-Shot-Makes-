I thought it would be interesting to create an app that helps visualize various NBA shot metrics’ relationships with each other, and use the k-nearest neighbors algorithm to predict makes and misses using those metrics. I used data-wrangling techniques we learned in class to filter my data for the top 20 NBA players from the 2014-2015 season and clean the dataset column names and rename some. I used a mutation that I learned in another class to recode the value of a column to 1’s and 0’s. I next used the knn methods we learned in class to create a workflow, split the data, create a recipe, specify a model, fit the model, and test the model. I then used techniques we learned in class to cross-validate the model and find the most optimal k value. I chose a k value of 40 in order to maximize specificity, which I deemed most important in this context. I then created a shiny app using mostly techniques we learned throughout this class. There were a few things I found on Shiny’s website, such as using page_navbar and nav_panel, as well as changing plot dimensions.
